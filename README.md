## About

Wow Daisy UI is a WordPress theme which follows a step-by step tutorial on how to create a traditional WP theme using modern technologies. Simply start at Part 1 and work your way through.

Part 1 - Initial setup of WordPress, Laravel Mix, Blank Slate WP Theme, Tailwind and Daisy UI (https://www.worldoweb.co.uk/2023/awesome-daisy-ui-wordpress-theme-part-1)




### Built With
- VS Code
- WordPress
- Local by Flywheel
- Node
- Tailwind
- Laravel Mix
- Daisy UI


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A local WordPress Development Environment and Node installed. A code editor such as VS Code. Some knowledge of the command line, PHP and the WordPress API recommended but not essential.  

### Installation

For the initial setup follow Part 1 the tutorial or alternatively clone this repo and run npm install. 

## Usage

Each tutorial will continue to add Dasiy UI components. At the end of part 1 there will be a very basic blank WordPress theme which is not suitable for a production site. As the tutorial progresses there will be a functional WP theme, each with its own branch. 

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ridgey28/wow-daisy-ui/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
